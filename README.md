# sapper-template

This is a fork of the sapper default template with a slight modification to replace Cypress with webdriver.io. It also splits the api and public facing pages up.

### Running the project

However you get the code, you can install dependencies and run the project in development mode with:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev
```

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start clicking around.
